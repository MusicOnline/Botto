A template for bots written using discord.py.
As much I'd like to release this on PyPI, it seems more logical for this git repository to be forked and worked off of.
This project is very much still work in progress.

You may read the documentation for discord.py [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
You can join the Discord server for support using this template.
